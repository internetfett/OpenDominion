name: Nox
alignment: evil
description: >-
  <p>The Nox, also called The Children of the Night, are a collection of hopeless and corrupt beings, neither living nor dead, neither spirit nor flesh, and so old their ancestry is only ever described as "arcane."</p>
  <p>Abandoned by the deities and forgotten by the ancient ones, the Nox are on a relentless pursuit into the darkness to find meaning and purpose.</p>
  <p>The Nox can be found in the deepest, gloomiest swamplands where even the Undead and Dark Elves dare not venture.</p>
  <p>Their allegiance to the Empire is absolute and the Empress holds them in high regard.</p>
  <p>Many believe their vile burial pits are to blame for the Growth.</p>
