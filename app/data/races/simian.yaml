description: >-
  <p>Simians live in the rain forests where neither Orcs nor elves or even Sylvans venture. Until recently, their only contact has been with the Beastfolks.</p>
  <p>During the rainy season, the Simians take shelter in the thickets and hunker down behind strong barricades to keep the rain and unwanted visitors away.</p>
