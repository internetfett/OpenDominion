        <ol class="mb-2 ps-3">
            <li><b>Actions</b>: every hero chooses an action in secret, and they're revealed once everyone has locked in.</li>
            <li><b>Status</b>: Defend, Guard, Counter, Rally and Recover's defense penalty take effect first, so they apply to every attack that turn.</li>
            <li><b>Damage</b>: attacks and counters deal their damage.</li>
            <li><b>Healing</b>: Recover and Heal restore health.</li>
            <li><b>Defeats</b>: anyone at 0 health is defeated. Healing comes first, so it can save an ally from that turn's damage.</li>

        <h5 class="h6 fw-bold">Damage</h5>
        <ul class="mb-0 ps-3">
            <li>Attack damage is your attack value minus the target's defense value. For example, 40 attack against 20 defense deals 20 damage.</li>
            <li>Evasion is the target's percent chance to halve the damage of an attack.</li>
            <li>Counter damage is your attack value plus your counter value, minus the attacker's defense value. Counters can't be evaded.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5 class="h6 fw-bold">Limits</h5>
        <ul class="mb-0 ps-3">
            <li>Attack, Defend and Guard can be used every turn.</li>
            <li>Counter, Focus and Recover can't be used two turns in a row. Rally shares Focus's cooldown, and Heal shares Recover's.</li>
            <li>Each hero can use Recover or Heal {{ $recoverCharges }} times per battle.</li>
            <li>Defending two turns in a row leaves you Exposed: your defense value drops by {{ $exposedPenalty }} before it doubles.</li>
